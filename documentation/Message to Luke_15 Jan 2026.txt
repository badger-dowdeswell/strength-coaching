Hi Luke,

Love to catch up with you on a call sometime soon to discuss and demonstrate the Block Training Schedule program with you. I completed an important part over the last few days: both the editing and the file update parts are working fine.

The next stage is to discuss each field in-depth to make sure that the way they work aligns with either the current spreadsheet or improves on it in line with your thinking. 

The live server is not up-to-date yet but if I can share my screen with you, I can show you how it works.  In a simple summary:

- We can control how each field is formatted and displayed.

- Each field that is editable by the client is under our control, so we can validate and re-format whatever they enter while they are entering it.

- The database updates properly.
