# Strength Research Online

Strength Research Online provides interactive personal fitness and strength training to clients. The applications help them manage their training programs and track their progress.

## Architecture and development environment
The front-end web application is written in React 19 using Tailwind CSS, managed by the Vite framework. The mobile version is written in React Native using the Expo framework.

The back-end is written in JavaScript using Node.js. Both the web and the mobile version share the same back-end. It provides a set of custom Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to control access to the main Strength Research Online database. This provides secure storage to the client profiles and training schedules. It uses the PostgrSQL relational database and implements strong authentication and security to manage back-end interaction and data exchange.
